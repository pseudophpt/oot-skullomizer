# Ocarina of Time Skullomizer by finap13 / pseudophpt
## Usage
You can run the skullomizer by typing 
``` python skullomizer.py ```
You will be prompted for a seed, which can be anything. Agree on a seed with your friends to get the same skull sequence.

Whenever you finish getting a skull, type in the skull number into the prompt and a new skull will be generated.
