# Ocarina of Time Skullomizer by finap13 / pseudophpt
## Usage
You can run the skullomizer by typing 

``` python skullomizer.py ```

You will be prompted for a seed, which can be anything. Agree on a seed with your friends to get the same skull sequence.

Then, you will be asked if you would like bonus points, and if so, how many, as well as if you would like to use flash mode.

Whenever you finish getting a skull, type in the skull number into the prompt and a new skull will be generated.
## How it's Played
Upon starting, all players are given 5 skulls. Any time a player retrieves one of these skulls, they get a point, and a new skull is generated in it's place.

To receive bonus points, you must complete a skulltula from position 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Getting two skulltulas from the same position do not carry over.

There are several different ways to play. Of course, you can try solo for the best score, or with teams for collaboration

### Countdown

A timer is set at some pre-determined time, such as 1 or 2 hours, and it counts down. When the timer becomes 0, all players must stop, and the player with the most points wins. 

### Race

Two players race to get a certain amount of points. 5 point races are short, 10 point races are medium, and for a long (possibly team) race, you can use 25 points.

### Elimination Mode

This can be played as a countdown or a race. However, when your opponent gets a skull, you also must clear it, however without geting points. This mode does not use bonus points.

### Flash Mode

Any time you get a skulltula, all 5 of your current skulls are changed.
